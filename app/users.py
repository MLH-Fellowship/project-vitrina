As a result I'm starting to look deeper into topics like Machine Learning, Autonomous Vehicles and Humanoid Robotics. Currently I'm starting to focus on growing my skills in C++, Python, Operating Systems and Data Structures and Algorithms. I have a background in IT, which led to me gaining interest in Cloud Computing as well. On my personal interests, I absolutely love hackathons, they are great way to meet others and to explore new topics and push boundaries. As a result of them, I've started to become interested in joining both Kaggle Competitions and Robotics Tournaments."
